# New Happenings

- everything goes smoothly for 10 days while waiting for repairs to finish and leveling up
- flushing out the inn a bit and working towards a functioning tavern
- higher a bunch of strangers to run the tavern for us
- last minute panicked advertisement
- we have not done much
- chilling at a bar doing nothing
- wants to go find some adventure to chase
- made a bunch of money
- a whole bunch of nothing happened
