# Breaking and Entering But the Good Kind

- Floon has a dungeon in his basement
- creepy bowl in the middle of the room containing 45 gold coins
- parchment under the bowl with an etching under the parchment
- diagonally, through the door, exact change
- three doors all closed with no handles
- each have a one inch by half inch slot where a handle normally would go
- adding a gold to the bowl does nothing
- pushing on the door does nothing
- no obvious mechanism for detcting the weight
- coin in northern door triggered a trap

```
Diagonally, the same is so.
A plea of warning to carefully count;
No two places may hold the same amount.
What coins in the center be fed through the door;
Exact change for passage or trouble galore.
```

- find a chest in the north drawer with a bag and a scroll
- south has hallway
- east door opens up even with the south door open
- treasure room dont touch
- secret room with some levers
- big doors have massive room with massive metal orb in the middle
- treasure room has lots of loot with some more writign on the door
- only fools tread where they should not go
- evil doors try to kill us
