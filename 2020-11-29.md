# To Murder a Murderer

- hot elf staring at us knocking on door saying someone was innocent
- neighbors had house broken into
- random wizard streaking though the sky wearing black
- it is not normal to see wizard streaking through the sky
- 3 griffons are chasing him down
- heading back to the skewered dragon to possibly track down the murderer
- ottobrand family had 2 casualties
- find an abandoned flat near a tavern to set up some bait
- guildhall of the dungsweeper guild
