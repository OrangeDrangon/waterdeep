# An Encounter with Dragons

- keeping some triton workers at bay as they swim around the harbor
- causing trouble but not causing harm
- well defended area of the city and under heavy watch
- the dragon makes everyone extremely nervous
- various sightings around the harbor forming a bit of a triangle
- find a bronze dragon underwater who reminds us not to touch our gold
- kelarion is born and raised in athcala
- can shape shift at will
- zelifarn is the name of the dragon in the harbor
- hands us a large bronze scale in order to reassure the blackstaff that he will not cause any harm
- taking a few days of rest
