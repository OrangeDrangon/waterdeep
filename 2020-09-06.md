# An Interesting Beginning

- Magistrate and Protectors are wizards who focus on protecting people
- Barnabus Blastwind is the one giving us the work
- Magistrate is a bit short handed
- Prior to our journey to waterdeep a group known as the cult of the dragon caused destruction attempting to resurrect tiamat
- they were stopped but those around are in dire need
- merchants arriving but carts are being ransacked on the way
- being asked to put a stop to this
- last report was a large beast on all fours
- feline cat on two legs
- extremely important to recover the goods if possible
- deterring the beasts is a second objective
- no pattern in the guilds being hit
- if we complete all of our tasks we get a 3 mark bonus
- very dense forest packed together
- sent some dragons on the way
