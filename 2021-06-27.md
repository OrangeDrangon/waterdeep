# Caving

- sliding down path through a fissure into cordined off peice of mine
- walls are damp
- glints of metal reflecting off of light spell
- various sections have some sort of ore along the wall with lots of colors
- glowing moss scatter around
- a couple of kobolds hiding out in the deep
- fireball wored perfectly everything died
- kill a giant purple worm 6 ears
- path continues down to a natural way large crack in wall
